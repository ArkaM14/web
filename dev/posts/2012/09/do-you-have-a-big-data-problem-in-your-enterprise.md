Last week I co-presented a webinar for [BodhTree](http://www.bodhtree.com). Title of the Seminar was ‘Is my problem a Big Data problem?’. Target audience were Enterprise BI Managers and C-Level executives, trying to understand if they had a Big Data problem at hand and what could be the steps to identify and then start off with their first Big Data project.

The recording of the webinar is embedded below. Here is [BodhTree](http://www.bodhtree.com)'s official [Big Data Home Page](http://www.bodhtree.com/bigdata.php?mkt_tok=3RkMMJWWfF9wsRonvanJZKXonjHpfsX56%2BQsWaaylMI%2F0ER3fOvrPUfGjI4GTct0dvycMRAVFZl5nQ5XHuiBboVF).
