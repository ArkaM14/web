# Web
After waffling for over 5 years on the sumitmaitra.com repository
I decided it was time to start fresh and just go with the static website
like I've done for the PiOfThings.net site.

So here we are, a Poet based static website going up on sumitmaitra.com

## Influence of Fediverse
I recently managed to join Mastodon and was gobsmacked at how well the federated social media system worked. As a result, most of the work
I did in sumitmaitra.com is now redundant. I am hoping in the near future I'll run my own Mastodon instance and the social aspects of sumitmaitra.com will be covered through that.

## Wordpress exports are a bit raw
All the posts upto 2021-3-20 are imported from my wordpress site sumitmaitra.wordpress.com. I will "sunset" it eventually. Some of the exported images still point back to Wordpress, and some of the markdown conversion maybe a little rough. I'll go through all of my old posts and mark them up correctly. Until I am done bear with.

## Sharing is disabled for now
I need to write a bit of script to enable sharing to Mastodon. So for now I've disabled sharing altogether. You can ofcourse subscribe to the Atom/RSS feed.
