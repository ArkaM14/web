If you are wondering what on the earth is Wrexit, that's my twisted take on moving my blog from WordPress to self hosted, self built static website based on the very nice library called [Poet](). Last month I quit Twitter and finally was able to join Mastodon and then got to know what is `Fediverse`. `Fediverse` or `Federated universe` is the virtual land of Federated online presence built mostly around the `ActivePub` protocol. As to `taking back control` that's another twisted take at moving my content away from VC based `big social` to smaller self hosted niches. 

## Taking back control... of my blog
I started blogging in 2007 and was happy when I started with Wordpress. Somewhere down the line it got a little stale and I have been trying to get my blog off Wordpress for a while. I initially built my [ElectricEdit app]() as a Wordpress blog editor but then wanted to convert it to a `WordPress converter` but somewhere between work, robotics, diy and life in general all that got lost. When I launched [Pi of things](https://piofthings.net/) I picked a much simpler platform, partly fueled by my itch to try out NodeJS and partly because I wanted [Pi of things](https://piofthings.net) to be hosted on an actual `Raspberry Pi`. So I needed a nice static site generator. Back then I found [Poet]() a nice and simple project that I cloned. It used `Jade` templates, which I upgraded to `Pug` in my fork. After going dormant for years, I was happy to see the orignal project got those updates as well. I still maintain my fork and try to keep it updated as much as possible. This blog is now the second Poet powered blog I am hosting. I've `taken back control` of my blog, after all these years.

## Enter the Fediverse
For years I had envisioned a `personal online social place` that would be more like an immediate circle of friends and relatives. My previous attempts to join Mastodon had failed because I was trying to join a server that probably didn't want me.
