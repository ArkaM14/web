Hello All, Wish you all a Very Happy and Prosperous 2012.

With the cheesy part out of the way, another disclaimer, this is a non-techie/self-gloating/geeky article that you have every right to skip :-).

Those of you who follow me on twitter know by now that I have started writing for [www.dotnetcurry.com](http://www.dotnetcurry.com/%28S%282uohcm45u2pywi45baxdajy1%29X%281%29%29/Author.aspx?AuthorName=Sumit%20Maitra "www.dotnetcurry.com") . I re-published one of my recent articles (the SignalR one) there and boy it got popular. But the best surprise was it got posted on asp.net community site as the article of the day. Now for a rank outsider like me this was big and I was gloating about it for a couple of days. The article was garnering about 800+ hits per day (more than all the hits I get on my blog in a week :-) ) Then something happened yesterday morning. In the space of an hour I noticed we had nearly 2000 hits. I couldn't believe my eyes. I thought that some spam bot had got hold of the url and was generating the hits. Then I actually visited the article and saw that it had about 60+ tweets. This surprised me. On clicking to see who was tweeting I nearly fell off my chair. First name on the list was "Scott Guthrie". **The Gu** had actually [tweeted](https://twitter.com/#!/scottgu/status/154594004879679488 "tweeted") about my article! Yeeehhhhaawwwww!!!! Needless to say I got 3K hits yesterday. If this ever gets to him, Thank you sir for your encouragement. (I will in a self-congratulatory frame of mind assume his tweet meant he liked my article).

The only thing better would be a ticket back home to be with my son and family.

Well, that's how life rolls. Hopefully I'll be able to do a lot of blogging this year and positively contribute to the tech community in general and .NET community in particular.

Cheers everyone!
