#### \[ This post is an outburst, so it has strong language and I don’t care if it hurts your sentiments, I’ve had enough. \]

The past three weeks has seen an outpouring of rage in India’s capital city, Delhi. I don’t have the heart to word what the flashpoint was. It was inhuman and barbaric, perpetrated by the sick-in-the-head people who deserve to be publicly stoned to death! Yes, a barbaric ending for the Neanderthal people who committed a heinous crime!

It was amazing to see the near spontaneous protest that formed, and then there was a sickening feeling in the gut when the government cracked down brutally on it! I mean how can the govt. crack down on a peaceful apolitical demonstration?

People are angry and arguably angry at the Govt. because the Govt. is where law-and-order is supposed to stem from, instead Govt. has become the flag-bearer of apathy to public sentiment. Simply speaking, to the common man, the Govt. doesn’t give a shit!

A lot of ink has been spilled over the last 15 days on what should change in Laws/Rules/Regulations blah blah!

Today I have a few questions for the people of India, ask these questions to yourself and act upon what’s missing. You don’t have to answer me!

#### Question 1: Have you had enough of a free ride? Democracy is not an auto-pilot where someone else votes, some people to power and some people form a govt. NO!!! You have to vote, you have to elect and you have to CHOOSE who forms a govt.

For years the so called educated middle class have treated day of voting as a holiday and for years the political system has been diverted by scoundrels, goons, ruffians and criminals. If you have criminals ruling the country how do you expect it to be run properly?

Start [here](http://eci.nic.in/eci_main1/index.aspx) by getting yourself a Voter ID, then go register yourself as a voter in your constituency! No FUCKING EXCUSES!

#### Question 2: So called Men of the country, are you really men?

Fucking MAN UP! Denigrating a woman makes you a wiener! If you can’t control your libido because women wear short-skirts maybe you should use your hand more often wank off your lonely pitiful existence!!!

Women are not objects, women are not there to serve you and they are definitely not there to be poked/prodded/groped or insulted every time they are in a public place. Again if you can’t control your hands, well use it to hold on to your wiener and keep your fucking trap shut!!!

#### Question 3: Stop feeding the corruption, what goes around comes around!

Stop feeding corruption at all levels, be it voting for a rapist/murderer/scumbag politician or bribing the havaldar for not getting your PUC done on time or getting a driving license without appearing for the test!!!

#### Question 4: To politicians – Stop being jerks!

It takes just one women oriented issue to get all the male jerks out of their woodwork. You hear comments like ‘dented and painted women’ or ‘paison ke liye thumke lagati thi’. You guys are big walking dicks for making such comments!!!

Women politicians, stop being bigger jerks by trying to convert a woman’s violation as a political drama!

#### Question 5: To the protectors of Law, stop harming people you swore to protect!

Yes, you have very little motivation to do well, you may have paid a huge amount of bribe to get your lowly positions in the ‘force’, the few of you who have had the motivation have been repeatedly scuttled by your political bosses, all that still doesn’t prevent you from ‘trying’ to do what is right!

\- Don’t brutalize the victim of crime.

\- Take suo-moto cognizance of the complaint.

\- Don’t insult women who have had the guts to come report a crime.

\- And answer all the questions above for yourself!

#### End of the Day

Yes, I am mad, I am frustrated, I really don’t know what needs to be done, but I know one thing, I live in a democracy, and no 66A is going to stop me from doing the right thing. BE PREPARED INDIA! Speak with your VOTE! You’ve had enough or ruffians/goons/sleazebags/rapists rule the country! TIME TO SPEAK IS NOW!!!
