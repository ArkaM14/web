I started this blog with an account of my LA trip yesterday. At the time the Patriots were thrashing the Colts 21-3 in the first half. My strong conviction that Colts were destined for the superbowl was looking a little shaken... But then... in the dying minutes of the half, Colts pulled back a little with a field goal to leave the field at 21-6... two touchdowns away from the Patriots. On his way out Tony Dungy said - we need to make one touch down and get this down to a one score game... we'll take it from thereon...

What happened after the break is now written in annals of AFC football history. I was riveted to the TV screen as the Colts stormed back with superb offensive play led by Manning to equal at 21-21 including an 8 point play, with 4 minutes to go in the third quarter. That probably stunned the Patriots. Suddenly Brady wasn't looking that menancing any more. The Colts defence showed flashes of their grit that they had exhibited in the last two playoff games. With Colts playing catch up all the time Patriots scored one more touchdown and one field goal but Colts came right back with a touchdown and field goal to level things at 31-31. However things got very interesting in the last 4 minutes of the game with the score standing at 34-31 in favour of Patriots. That's when Manning and Colts held their nerve and with about a minute to go Addai scored a touchdown while Vinatieri scored with the kick to put Colts in the lead for the first time in the game (38-34). With one minute to go Brady lined up for his last attempt at winning the game but a fantastic interception by Marlin Jackson ended their hopes of another Superbowl.

My roomie, the guy responsible for getting me addicted to American Football nodded at me and commented at my rooting (for Colts) ... "what a monster I've created..." Well bro you got me hooked :) ... and I am a Colts fan now (hook, line and sinker ;-) ...)
